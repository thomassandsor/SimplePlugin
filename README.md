## Plugin for dummies - Simple Plugin

Pro-Code can for some people seem like it's miles away, and something you might not ever be able to do. After the release of Chat GPT, this is no longer the issue. This code is a part of a longer (7 videos) YouTube series that has been developed for NON-Devs to manage their first plugin. You don't need any prior skill in coding to be able to complete this plugin. you can literally just follow every step and make it work. 

The intention of this course is to give you the starting knowledge so that you can advance further if you feel this is within your interrest. Most important thing to succeed with this course is to try, try and try some more. Eventually you will learn something new that you didn't know before.
